This binding does not cross threads:
(with-local-vars [gas 99] (register-event *plugin* "player.player-move" (fn [_] (println @gas))))
It reports 'unnamed' and 'Unbound'.

This and (binding) do the same thing--the original value is
unreplaced.
(with-redefs [gas 99] (register-event *plugin* "player.player-move" (fn [_] (println gas))))
